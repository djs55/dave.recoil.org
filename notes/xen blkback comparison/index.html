<h1>Comparison between XCP linux 2.6.32 and linux 3.0 blkback</h1>
<p>
This is an attempt to describe the differences -- from a toolstack point
of view -- between the &quot;classic xen&quot; blkback used in XCP and
the upstream blkback in linux 3.0. In particular I attempt the answer the
questions:
<p>
<ol>
<li> if xapi switched over to a &quot;traditional&quot; udev script (where &quot; traditional &quot; in this context means: where the toolstack writes the &quot;params&quot; xenstore key and then the udev script writes the &quot;physical-device&quot; key), will it work with the existing XCP kernel?
<li> if xapi uses the traditional disk hot unplug mechanism (instead of the &quot;shutdown-request&quot;) mechanism, will it work with the existing XCP kernel?
<li> if xapi uses the same migrate disk handling as libxl, will it work with the existing XCP kernel?
<li> if xapi runs on an upstream 3.0 kernel, what features are lost?
</ol>

<h1> Code locations </h1>
The toolstack-relevant portions of blkback are here:
<ul>
<li>linux-2.6.32/drivers/xen/blkback/xenbus.c
<li>linux-3.0/drivers/block/xen-blkback/xenbus.c
</ul>

<h1> Initialisation code </h1>
Comparing 3.0 xen_blkback_probe with 2.6.32 blkback_probe:
<ul>
<li> 2.6.32 calls xenvbd_sysfs_addif to populate sysfs early
<li> 2.6.32 registers a watch on &quot;shutdown-request&quot; with callback start_shutdown
<li> 2.6.32 registers a watch on &quot;pause&quot; with callback backend_pause
<li> 2.6.32 writes &quot;max-ring-page-order&quot;
</ul>

The backend/frontend handshake code is event driven, via the functions
backend_changed and frontend_changed.

Comparing 3.0 frontend_changed with 2.6.32 frontend_changed:
<ul>
<li> 2.6.32 only reconnects if the state isn't Connected or Closing (?)
<li> 2.6.32 will call blkif_bdev_reopen: possibly to make pause/resize/unpause work
</ul>

Comparing a 3.0 backend_changed with a 2.6.32 backend_changed:
<ul>
<li> 3.0 creates sysfs nodes only when physical-device is read
<li> 2.6.32 writes feature-barrier
</ul>

<h1> Pause/unpause code </h1>

The pause/unpause functions were added in XCP blktap1 to support online snapshot. They were added to blkback to support online resize, where the unpause would trigger a refresh of the disk size information in the windows frontend.

Online resize was never made into a first-class feature of XCP, so we don't have to worry about loosing pause/unpause.

<h1> Shutdown protocols </h1>

There are two kinds of device shutdowns:
<ol>
<li>hot-unplug
<li>on domain destruction
</ol>
In the XCP blkback the two protocols are:
<ol>
<li> xapi writes backend/shutdown-request=normal (or =force for domain destruction)
<li> blkback shuts down
<li> blkback unregisters devices
<li> blkback writes backend/shutdown-done
<li> udev script runs
</ol>
In the upstream tools in the hot unplug case:
<ol>
<li> libxl writes backend/state=5 (closing)
<li> blkback shuts down
<li> udev script runs
</ol>
and the domain destruction case
<ol>
<li> libxl removes the frontend tree
<li> blkback shuts down
<li> udev script runs>
</ol>
In the start_shutdown function (called on receipt of &quot;shutdown-request&quot; watches), it calls blkback_queue_stop(be, 1, force=0) which sets the backend state to closing (5). When the frontend closes (6), frontend_changed will set the backend to closed (6) and then call blkback_queue_stop(be, 1, force=1). Since the first blkback_queue_stop(be, 1, force=0) only sets the backend state to closing (5) it would be safe for xapi to do this itself.

In the case of a &quot;shutdown-request=force&quot; if xapi were to delete the frontend then the frontend_changed function would be called with the state XenbusStateUnknown. This would call device_unregister() which would tear everything down.
<h1> Summary </h1>
<ol>
<li> Can xapi switch to a traditional udev script (with params instead of physical-device): yes
<li> Can xapi switch to the upstream protocols for hotplug: yes
<li> Can xapi switch to the upstream protocols for domain shutdown: yes
<li> If xapi runs on a 3.0 kernel, what features are lost: multi-ring support, feature-barrier
