<h1>The Primitives</h1>
Xen devices are built from the following low-level primitives:

<h2> Memory pages </h2>
These are the basic unit of memory exposed to guests. Note that xen supports pages of different sizes (see <a href="">superpages</a>) but for the rest of this article I will talk about 4KiB pages.

<h2> Grants </h2>
Xen allows guests to grant read-only or read-write access to other guests. This allows memory to be moved or shared between guests.

Grants are stored in <emph>Grant tables</emph> which are blocks of memory with a special format. These tables are shared between the Guests and Xen.

</ul>

<h2> Event channels</h2>
An event channel is a mechanism to signal a remote domain, which looks similar to a hardware interrupt. Event channels are typically used to signal when fresh data is available in some shared memory pages.

<h1> Rings </h1>

<p>
Xen devices construct <emph>rings</emph> which are used for request/response (RPC-like) communication. A ring normally fits within a single 4KiB page. The page contains a header and a power-of-two number of fixed-size slots. Rings are shared between two peers, one of whom will write requests while the other only writes responses.
</p>

<p>
Note there are some <a href="http://xen.1045712.n5.nabble.com/Add-multi-page-shared-ring-support-to-xen-blkfront-back-td2513205.html">blkfront/back patches</a> to allow a ring to be split across multiple pages, to allow larger numbers of outstanding requests. This is considered particularly important for block I/O against high-performance targets such as expensive FC arrays or local SSD storage.
</p>

<h2> A Ring with no requests or responses </h2>
<p>
This is the initial state where no requests or responses have been sent (&quot;pushed&quot;). We adopt the convention that requests are written anti-clockwize around the ring, as indicated by the arrow. Note the contents of each slice depends on the higher-level protocol in use (<emph>xenbus</emph>, <emph>network</emph>, <emph>block</emph>).
